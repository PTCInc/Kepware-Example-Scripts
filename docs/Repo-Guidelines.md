# Repository Guidelines

This repository is intended to provide end users access to example solutions to common use cases, collaborate and share as necessary, and share feedback on issues they may have. The repository is owned and maintained by the Kepware Solutions Consulting team at PTC.

Because the examples for these use cases are provided "as-is" per the [licensing terms](../license.md) there is no guarenteed response whenever an Issue is reported or question posted. In some cases, the owners may reach out to you directly in response to an issue/question and coordinate other means to share data as needed.

## Versions of Script Files

Script files have versions, which follow the pattern: \<major>.\<minor>.\<update>, where minor versions of a major version should be backwards compatible with each other. The \<update> designation is for updates to a script for issue resolution.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests can be created by any user wanting to contribute to the repo. The owners of the repo will approve pull requests as changes are reviewed and will determine if changes meet the intent of the repository.

## Issues and Discussions in Github

The Issues and Discussions features of GitHub will be used as the primary means of communication.  An issue may be a bug report or identifying an issue found with a script. When creating or working issues, contributors are encouraged to use permalinks to link to other files in a repo.  Crosslinking of issues, when they are related, is also encouraged. When creating pull requests that resolve issues, include the Issue as a cross link in the PR.

If there is a question about how to use a script, recommended feature request, or general inquiries should be made in the Discussions section of the repo.
