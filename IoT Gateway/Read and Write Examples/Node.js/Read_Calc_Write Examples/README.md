# NodeJS example with IoT Gateway REST agents

This node.js apps provide examples on how to read and write values to Kepware using the IoT Gateway REST interfaces. The [Generic_Read_Write](Generic_Read_Write) reads values from the Kepware IoT Gateway REST server interface and writes values back to Kepware.

The [Loading_Data_third_party_API_to_Kepware](Loading_Data_third_party_API_to_Kepware) example gathers data from a weather station API and sends the data to Kepware for other applications, such as SCADA/HMI, can receive the data from Kepware.

There is a Kepware project file [NodeJsSample.opf](NodeJsSample.opf) that has the configuration ready to run the examples with.
